# Leetcode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 
# Constraints:
# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        seen_set=set()
        left = 0

        for right,char in enumerate(s):
            # 1. Check if the new char is present within the sliding window or not.
            # 2. If present, shrink the sliding window till the window is valid.
            while char in seen_set:
                seen_set.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            
            # 3. Expand the sliding window to include the new char.
            seen_set.add(s[right])

            # 4. Update the maximum length.
            result = max(result,right-left+1)
        
        return result
